{\em Document research:}

The theoretical foundation will be through papers in the topics indicated in
the introduction, RDS, bayesian statistics, and prevalence estimation through
regression. 

{\em Technical resources:}

All the necessary programming will be done in the programming languages
\textit{Python} and \textit{R}, given the simple connection to data processing
and
statistics. 

{\em Formal study:}

In order to help the learning about the foundations, two subjects from the
PhD in Mathematical Modelling at EMAp will be taken: Bayesian Statistics and
Network Science. The first one ended in June, while the second will be
finished on September.
