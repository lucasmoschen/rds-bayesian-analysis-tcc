\section{Main}

The objective of this work is to analyze the network structure of RDS as a
stochastic object, along with the sensibility and sensitivity. We also intend
to apply this framework efficiently, comparing Monte Carlo algorithms and
Laplace approximations.



\section{Specifics}

\begin{alineas}
    \item Bibliography review including possible mathematical formulations of
    RDS, logistic regression when the outcome has uncertainty (imperfect
    tests) and applications in hidden or hard-to-reach populations; 

    \item Problem description in mathematical terms considering the
    uncertainty in the network (missing data in the RDS) and the
    diagnose. Uncertainty propagation; 

    \item Bayesian methods and prior calibration. Prior predictive checking on
    the positive test probability when there are weak priors of the
    regression parameters; 

    \item Joint prior distribution for sensitivity and specificity of the
    diagnostic test;

    \item Efficient implementation using statistical packages, as {\em
    rstanarm} \cite{rstanarm} and {\em INLA} \cite{rue2009approximate}. Comparison between MCMC and Laplace
    approximation; 

    \item Analysis of RDS epidemiological studies.
