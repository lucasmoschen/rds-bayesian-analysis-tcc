    "\n",
    "Consider a population of interest and a known condition, such as, for example,\n",
    "a disease or a binary behavior. It is important to understand the proportion\n",
    "of individuals in this population exposed at time $t$, called *prevalence*. \n",
    "Suppose that a diagnostic test is done to measure the presence or the\n",
    "absence of this condition in the individuals. Mathematically, let $\\theta \\in\n",
    "(0,1)$ be the prevalence (parameter of interest) of the condition and $Y_i$ be\n",
    "an indicator function of the presence of the condition in the $i$th.\n",
    "individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming for simplicity that all tests are performed at time $t$, and the\n",
    "sample is $\\{y_1, ..., y_n\\}$, the maximum likelihood estimator is the\n",

    "However, this estimator has two problems in this context: it assumes a perfect\n",
    "diagnostic test, which is often incorrect, and the samples in RDS are not\n",
    "independent by definition (network structure). \n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem in {eq}`eq:naive-estimator` was tackled several times in\n",
    "the literature, such as {cite:t}`mcinturff2004modelling`. The second problem\n",
    "was a study object in {cite:t}`heckathorn1997,heckathorn2002` where the\n",
    "estimator was proposed based largely on Markov chain theory and social network theory.\n",
