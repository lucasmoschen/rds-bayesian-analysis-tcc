    "# Understanding E-BFMI\n",
    "\n",
    "When I was studying a model for my disseration, a warning was displayed by Stan: E-BFMI was too low. In order to understand why it happens, [this link](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/issues-with-e-bfmi-missing-doc-confusing-name-etc/22553) is very useful. Moreover, [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00695.pdf) is very explanatory, so I will follow it in this notebook.  \n",
